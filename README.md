## Restrictions

- Works only with the electrical heaters and not the TRVs as I do not have them in my system
- Get and set schedule for all or one room not available yet

# Integration installation & setup

It is highly recommended to use HACS to install the integration. Please see HACS website for more information at https://hacs.xyz/

## Installation

- Add the Github repository to HACS as an integration 
- In the integration page look for Wiser Smart Component for Home Assissant

![](https://github.com/tomtomfx/wiserSmartForHA/blob/master/docs/ha_hacs_wiser.png)

- Install it
- You will be asked to restart HA

## Setup integration

This component is using the config flow to avoid having to populate the configuration yaml file

- Go to integration and click on "+"
- Search "Wiser Smart"

![](https://github.com/tomtomfx/wiserSmartForHA/blob/master/docs/ha_integration.png)

- You will be asked for 4 parameters

```IP address``` is the IP address of the Wiser Smart Controller on your network

```Username``` is the username used to login on your local system (should be "admin")

```Password``` is the password that goes along the username (by default "admin")

```Scan Interval``` is the duration between two calls towards the Controller (A value too small may overlaod the controller)

## Mode select and automations

To set the working mode (manual, schedule, holiday, energysaver) add:

- An input_select to select the mode you want WiserSmart to be in

```
input_select:
  wisersmart_mode_select:
    name: WiserSmart mode
    options:
      - manual
      - schedule
      - energysaver
      - holiday
    initial: schedule
    icon: mdi:target
```
- Automations to ensure that the input_select is in the current mode by default and if changed sets WiserSmart in the selected mode

```
# Home mode input.select default value
- id: '1'
  alias: Set home mode to input select
  trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.wiser_operation_mode
  action:
   - service: input_select.select_option
     data_template:
       entity_id: input_select.wisersmart_mode_select
       option: "{{ states('sensor.wiser_operation_mode') }}"

# Set home mode using the input select
- id: '2'
  alias: Set home mode from input select
  trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: input_select.wisersmart_mode_select
  action:
   - service: wisersmart.set_home_mode
     data_template:
       mode: "{{ states('input_select.wisersmart_mode_select') }}"
       come_back_time: "{{ state_attr('input_datetime.back_from_vacation', 'timestamp') | int }}"

```
